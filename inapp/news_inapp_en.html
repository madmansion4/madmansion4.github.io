                    Thank you for waiting. The Feica 2.0 update is finally complete!<br><br>
                    This update is a result of our efforts to make Feica a better app, 
                    from design renewal to new features and usability improvement 
                    based on the feedback that users have sent to us.<br><br>
                    So let's take a closer look at what's been changed and what's new.
                </p>
                <p class="p-article-content-title-en-app text-center mb-2">1. Shooting ratios</p>
                <img class="img col-12 mb-1" src="/imgs/news/news_011/news_011_1.png">
                <p class="p-article-desc-en-app text-center mb-3">Various shooting ratios</p>
                <p class="p-article-content-en-app mb-4">
                    One of the features that users most wanted was 1: 1 shooting ratio.<br><br>
                    With this update, not only 1: 1 shooting ratio but also 3: 2 shooting ratio,
                    which is the basic ratio of analog film, has been added.
                </p>
                <p class="p-article-content-title-en-app text-center mb-2">2. Manual focus & exposure</p>
                <img class="img col-12 mb-1" src="/imgs/news/news_011/news_011_2.png">
                <p class="p-article-desc-en-app text-center mb-3">You can switch to the manual<br>by pressing the focus button.</p>
                <p class="p-article-content-en-app mb-4">
                    We added manual focus and exposure to this update.<br><br>
                    Under the basic philosophy that everyone should be able to enjoy 
                    the texture and sensitivity of analog film photography easily and comfortably, 
                    Feica has added two manual functions to support more professional shooting.
                </p>
                <p class="p-article-content-title-en-app text-center mb-2">3. Renewed app design</p>
                <img class="img col-12 mb-1" src="/imgs/news/news_011/news_011_3.png">
                <p class="p-article-desc-en-app text-center mb-3">Newly designed camera screen</p>
                <p class="p-article-content-en-app mb-4">
                    With the addition of new features, the camera design has also changed. 
                    The buttons have been trimmed, and the layout has also become more simple. <br><br>
                    Camera skin mode is still available for users who like the texture of the analog camera, 
                    and it provides a simple screen even when the skin is not used. However, 
                    the camera skin can only be used in normal mode.
                </p>
                <p class="p-article-content-title-en-app text-center mb-2">4. Auto save mode with real-time filtering</p>
                <img class="img col-12 mb-1" src="/imgs/news/news_011/news_011_4.png">
                <p class="p-article-desc-en-app text-center mb-3">Real-time filtering has been added to Auto save mode.</p>
                <p class="p-article-content-en-app mb-4">
                    Feica is an analog camera app, so you can not apply filters before shooting. 
                    However, at the request of many users, we decided to add real-time filtering to Auto save mode.<br><br>
                    Now, in Auto save mode, you can apply filters in real time before shooting.<br><br>
                    Please note that the film effect, which makes the picture look older, is automatically applied after the photo is taken.
                </p>
                <p class="p-article-content-title-en-app text-center mb-2">5. Adjust filter & film effect intensity</p>
                <img class="img col-12 mb-1" src="/imgs/news/news_011/news_011_5_1.png">
                <img class="img col-12 mb-1" src="/imgs/news/news_011/news_011_5_2_en.png">
                <img class="img col-12 mb-1" src="/imgs/news/news_011/news_011_5_3_en.png">
                <p class="p-article-desc-en-app text-center mb-3">In normal mode, you can adjust the intensity of the filter and film effect.</p>
                <p class="p-article-content-en-app mb-4">
                    We have added intensity adjustments to this update, as suggested by some users 
                    who want to control the intensity of the filter and film grain effect.<br><br>
                    In normal mode, you can adjust the intensity of the filter and film effect 
                    using the Edit button at the bottom of the preview image.<br><br>
                    The film effect is a combination of grain and blur, creating an older atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p class="p-article-content-title-en-app text-center mb-2">6. Improved usability</p>
                <img class="img col-12 mb-1" src="/imgs/news/news_011/news_011_6.png">
                <p class="p-article-desc-en-app text-center mb-3">You can import photos from Camera roll without returning to the camera.</p>
                <p class="p-article-content-en-app mb-4">
                    One of the inconveniences we've been receiving from users 
                    is that they have to go back to the camera screen to import another photo.<br><br>
                    We also think this is ineffective and have improved with this update.<br><br>
                    You can now access your album directly from the filter screen.
                    It also has direct access to options for date stamp, making it more convenient to use.<br><br>
                    In addition to the various features mentioned above, we also support Self Timer and Mirror mode, 
                    so please make great analog photos with the new Feica.

                    The newly added A filter set is made up of bright, high-contrast filters. It is a suitable filter to record everyday with photos.
                    <br><br>
                    In the Feica 1.9 update, not only a new filter set but also new light leak effects were added and the probability of appearance increased.

                    1.7 update is just around the corner, but after working hard,
                    we can now release the 1.8 update with options for the date stamp!
                    <br><br>
                    The options for date stamp are one of the features many of you would like to add.
                    So we rushed the 1.8 update. With this update, you can now specify the date and format you want in
                    the date stamp!
                </p>
                <img class="img col-12 mb-1" src="/imgs/news/news_006/news_006_1_en.png">
                <p class="p-article-desc-en-app text-center mb-3">A Date Stamp option button<br>has been added to the
                    settings.</p>
                <p class="p-article-content-en-app mb-4">
                    How to use date stamp options is very simple! Go to the settings and press the date stamp option
                    button to go to the detail setup page.
                    If the date stamp is off, the option button is not available.

                <p class="p-article-content-en-app mb-4">
                    There are two date stamp options, date and format.
                    You can select Date taken / Today / Custom date as the date,
                    and you can select the position of year / month / day as the format.
                    <br><br>
                    "Date taken" is the date the photo was taken.
                    If the photo was taken in the past, it will be displayed as the date the photo was taken.
                    Of course, if the photo was taken today, today's date will be displayed.
                    <br><br>
                    If you select 'Today', all photos will be displayed with today's date.
                    <br><br>
                    If you select 'Custom date', you can specify the date you want.
                    If you want to reset to a different date, tap the 'Custom date' button or Preview box to display
                    the date picker.

                <p class="p-article-desc-en-app text-center mb-3">The option to always run the camera<br>in Auto Save mode
                    has been added.</p>
                <p class="p-article-content-en-app mb-4">
                    There are also new additions.
                    <br><br>
                    There are two shooting modes of Feica. One is the Normal mode,
                    in which you can select and save the filtered photos after taking the photo or importing it from
                    your album,
                    and the other is the Auto Save mode, which allows you to shoot and save at the same time with the
                    pre-selected filter.
                    <br><br>
                    Previously, Feica kept the last shooting mode the user used, even when the app was restarted.
                    However, there were some people who accidentally changed to Auto Save mode by pressing the mode
                    change button and
                    could not find an album button that was only in Normal mode,
                    so We have added an option to prevent this situation.
                    <br><br>
                    Now when this option is turned on, the camera always runs in Auto Save mode.
                    Of course, you can easily change to Normal mode.
                    When this option is off, the camera always runs in Normal mode.
                    So if you do not turn this option on, you will not have trouble finding the album button.

                    We have been constantly updating various features since we launched Feica.
                    However, each feature was not fully explained. So in the future,
                    we will also provide a user guide whenever new features are added.
                    We want to make the app that are intuitive to use without the need for complicated descriptions or
                    guides.
                    But if you are uncomfortable in using our app because we do not have enough explanations,
                    we just need to improve it. We will continue to make Feica more cool and convenient.

                    We have added Auto Save mode to the Feica cam in the last 1.6 update.
                    Auto save mode is a shooting mode that allows you to shoot and save at the same time with a
                    pre-selected filter.
                    <br><br>
                    After updating the Auto Save mode, we have received feedback from some users who were no longer
                    able to import photos from Camera roll.
                    In Auto Save mode, the album button is replaced with a filter change button, which seems to have
                    caused this misunderstanding.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>From the bottom line, importing photos from Camera roll is still possible in Normal mode!</strong><br><br>
                    If you can not find the album button, tap or swipe the bottom of the shutter to change to Normal
                    mode. The album button will reappear.
